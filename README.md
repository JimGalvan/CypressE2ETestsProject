# Cypress E2E tests project

## Skills and Technologies Used

This project is a testament to my proficiency in various skills and technologies, including:

- **JavaScript**: Utilized for writing test scripts and automation logic.
- **Cypress**: Employed as the primary testing framework to conduct functional tests.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implemented to enhance test maintainability and reusability by encapsulating web page functionality into objects.
- **Google Maps API Interception**: Effectively intercept and manage Google Maps API requests, ensuring a controlled and reliable testing environment. This approach enables us to wait for API responses, mitigating potential timing issues and ensuring smooth and accurate test execution.

### Environment

To run this project and execute the Cypress test cases, the following environment is necessary:

- **Node.js**: Required for running JavaScript-based test scripts and Cypress.

 ### Description

The test case within this project serves to demonstrate and practice functional testing on a live website (space.aceparking.com). Importantly, it does so without accessing any private or sensitive information from the website. Furthermore, it's worth noting that this test case does not utilize any specific testing environment provided by space.aceparking.com. Instead, it interacts solely with free and publicly accessible functionality, ensuring that it operates within ethical and practical boundaries.

Specifically, the test case focuses on confirming that a guest user can seamlessly add a reservation to the cart. The steps involve selecting appropriate dates, specifying a leave-by time, and verifying the reservation and cart functionality to ensure a smooth user experience.

This comprehensive approach not only validates the application's functionality but also highlights my proficiency in Cypress and JavaScript, showcasing my ability to conduct functional tests while prioritizing user privacy and data security.
